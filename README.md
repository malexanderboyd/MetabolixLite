------------------------------------------------------Introduction--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Metabolix Lite is a product of Metabolix Nutrition. It is a new way for trainers subscribed to the Metabolix regimen to access their clients’ fitness records and nutritional information. Trainers employ Metabolix Nutrition’s proprietary dietary formula that has been researched by a board-certified doctor. In addition, Metabolix utilizes exclusive nutritional supplements to help their clients achieve their fitness goals at one of the many associated gyms in their network. 

--------------------------------------------------------Implementation----------------------------------------------------------------

This program has been developed in the Eclipse Java development environment. The graphical user interface was created with Java Swing. Java Swing is a built in widget of Java’s fundamental classes. 


To enable the functionality of this application, the development team has implemented a MySQL database. This database was created using MySQL Workbench and is hosted on the Towson.edu domain.


The program is using two external libraries. The first is a MySQL connector jar that allows our program to connect to the MySQL server. The second is Java mail API that allows our program to send emails to clients and trainers.

--------------------------------------------------------Installation------------------------------------------------------------------

To run this program the user must be on Towson University network or using the Towson University VPN as it requires a connection to the tritin.towson.edu database. One this connection has been done simply run the jar file and it will open the application.
